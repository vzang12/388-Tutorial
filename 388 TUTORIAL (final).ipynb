    "This tutorial will introduce you to the basics of the decision tree model, how to implement a classification decision tree, and how decision trees are used in real world applications, specifically in health and diagnosis of illnesses. Given some specific details about a person, can we predict if they have some illness, for example cancer or the flu? Many illnesses will have a list of symptoms where if you were to be experiencing some of them, you could have a high chance of having that illness. And so, decision trees are a great tool that will not only help make these predictions based on certain details, but also they provide a great visual that is very easy to understand."

    "A decision tree is a tree diagram where at each node, a decision can be made such that you follow the branches corresponding to which decision you made, and ultimately ending up at a leaf node with some possible outcome to the problem. At each internal node of a decision tree, there will be one value attribute, $x_i$, which can either be a discrete value or a continuous value. Each branch from a node selects one value for $x_i$, and each leaf node predicts the outcome $Y$. There are two main types of decision trees: classification trees and regression trees. In this tutorial, we will be working with classification decision trees which means that our outcome prediction is a discrete value. The regression tree predicts outcomes that can be considered real numbers."

Another stopping criteria is when the total entropy of the dataset is zero. This means that our data is perfectly classified and so there is no need to continue splitting.

    "As you can see, now we have a decision tree of depth 10. This decision tree can be easily followed because the lines on the left side tell us the depth of the node we are looking at. Branches are indicated by indents and the number of lines tell us how deep we are into the tree. When you reach a line that has no more indents, you have reached a leaf node because one of the stopping criteria has been met. For example, on the fourth line down from the top, Attended Large Gathering = Yes: [977 Yes/0 No], although this does not have depth 10, it no longer indents and splits anymore because this data is perfectly classified since all the examples are 'Yes'. At the line that says, Fatigue  = Yes: [38 No/28 Yes], this no longer splits further because the max depth of 10 was reached. When reading this tree top to bottom and you reach a leaf node, we explore the opposite path based on the previous node. At each line, you have the attribute name and then after the equals sign, you will then have a 'Yes' or 'No' value. This indicates whether a person has the attribute or does not have the attribute. Then, we see a ratio of 'Yes' and 'No' responses in brackets. These numbers indicate the subset of people who have COVID, based on their value for that attribute. In order to make a prediction based on someone's attribute, you take the larger proportion of people from the brackets. So for example, if we had someone who traveled abroad, we would predict that they do have COVID because following the tree, we see that Abroad travel = Yes: [2451 Yes/0 No] and the majority of people who have traveled abroad have COVID and so we predict that future people will also have COVID if they travel abroad."

This should make sense because as we split on more attributes, we are getting more and more specific and we can correctly classify the training examples. However, this does not mean we should always make our decision tree have a max depth where we use all possible attributes. This will cause overfitting because although our decision tree is getting better at predicting our training examples, we have no idea how well it will do on unseen data. Our model could very well be fitting the training data, but the training data is not always an accurate picture of unseen data and so we don't want our model to be too specific for just our training data.

    "One way to avoid overfitting your decision tree is called reduced error pruning. What you want to do is split your training data into a new training dataset as well as a validation set. It is typical to split 80%/20%. Then, using your new training set, train your tree so that it classifies the training dataset as best as possible (produces lowest possible error rate). Then using the validation set, we are going to prune the tree so that we produce the lowest error rate on the validation set. To do this, at each internal node, we consider turning it into a leaf node and pruning the tree below it. Then using this pruned tree, make predictions with the validation set and get the error rate. Keep repeating this process with every internal node, then choose the tree that gives the lowest validation error rate."
